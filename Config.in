config DPACK_ASSERT_API
	bool "API assertion"
	default n
	help
	  Build dpack library with high-level API assertions enabled to ensure
	  that API functions exposed by DPack will perform full verification of
	  arguments consistency.

config DPACK_ASSERT_INTERN
	bool "Internal assertion"
	select DPACK_ASSERT_API
	default n
	help
	  Build dpack library with internal assertions enabled to check for
	  internal DPack behavioral consistency.

	  additional features:
	  - reading / writing to / from STDIO files,
	  - error strings,
	  - custom dpack / mpack assertions,
	  - reader / writer tracking.

config DPACK_SCALAR

	bool "Double precision floating point numbers"
	depends on DPACK_SCALAR
	default n
	help
	  Build dpack library with double precision floating point number
	  support allowing to (de)serialize doubles.

config DPACK_STRING
	bool "Strings"
	default y
	help
	  Build dpack library with string support allowing to (de)serialize
	  strings according to duplicate and / or copy strategies.

config DPACK_STRING_MAXLEN
	int "Maximum strings length"
	default 4095
	depends on DPACK_STRING
	help
	  Enforce a maximum length over strings excluding the terminating NULL
	  byte.

config DPACK_LVSTR
	bool "Length-Value strings"
	select DPACK_STRING
	default y
	help
          Build dpack library with length-value string support allowing to
          (de)serialize strings into Stroll's lvstr objects. lvstr objects are

	help
          Build dpack library with MessagePack array support allowing to
	  (de)serialize lists of objects.

config DPACK_MAP
	bool "Maps"
	select DPACK_SCALAR
	default y
	help
          Build dpack library with MessagePack map support allowing to
	  (de)serialize structured aggregates of objects.
